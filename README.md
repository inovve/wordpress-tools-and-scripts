WooCommerce Tools and Scripts

📝 update-slugs.php
This WordPress snippet ensures that the slug (post_name) of any post, page, or custom post type is automatically updated to match the title whenever the title is changed.

By default, WordPress does not update the slug after the initial post creation, even if the title changes. This behavior is ideal for preserving permalinks, but can be undesirable if you want the URL to always reflect the current title.

This code hook fixes that by detecting changes to the title and forcing an update to the slug on save.

⚙️ Behavior
Applies to all public post types (post, page, and any custom post types with 'public' => true).

Updates the post_name (slug) to a sanitized version of the new title only if the title has changed.

Skips autosaves, revisions, and avoids infinite loops by temporarily unhooking itself.

Can be safely added to your theme’s functions.php or a custom plugin.

⚠️ Important Notes
SEO Warning: Changing slugs can break existing links. If this matters for your site, you should consider implementing a redirect system to forward old URLs to the new ones.

If you're using a plugin or theme that depends on fixed slugs, test carefully.

📦 Example Use Cases
Dynamic content where titles are frequently edited and you want URLs to match automatically.

Custom post types like projects, events, or documentation where SEO-friendly, title-based URLs are important.
